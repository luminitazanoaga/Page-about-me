        <h2>About me</h2>
        <h4>This is a shortcut description about me.</h4>
          <h4>My name is Luminita and i am, firstly, a happy man. </h4>
        <p>I am a student at the state university in Moldova. I learn through the bachelor's program in computer science.</p>
      <p>But this is not the most significant attribution of my personality. I do not stop myself perfecting the vision of life and everything that defines it.</p>

      <div class="card" id="thoughts">
        <h2>Some kind of brainstorming</h2>
        <h4>My lifestyle totally determines me, it's about balance, understanding, reality and acceptance.</h4>
      <p>
        It's not just about caring for the body through a balanced diet, sports and responsibility for the emotions experienced.
        But about the calm and open attitude towards what is or is not a normality.
        About being ok with failures and losses.
        About here and now. About inspiration and determination.</p>

      <div class="card" id="hobby">
        <h2>Hobby</h2>
        <p>From the age of 6, my parents decided to start studying music, in particular to play the piano.
          A year later I started studying the art of gala dancing, and then I honed my skills through sports and folk dance, up to 15 years.</p>
        <p>  However, now, my activities determine my lifestyle and not just my hobby.</p>
